# GravityAPI Fabric version

This is a fork of FusionFlux's fork of [Gravity API](https://github.com/Fusion-Flux/Gravity-Api) for Fabric. Because it moved to Quilt and stopped maintaining the Fabric version whilist Immersive Portals mod depends on it.

Gravity API is originally a fork of Gaider10's [Gravity Changer](https://github.com/Gaider10/GravityChanger).
