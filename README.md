# GravityChanger

This is a fork of FusionFlux's fork of [Gravity API](https://github.com/Fusion-Flux/Gravity-Api) for Fabric.
Gravity API is originally a fork of Gaider10's [Gravity Changer](https://github.com/Gaider10/GravityChanger).

Maintaining the fork because Immersive Portals mod depends on the Gravity changing mod, 
and Fabric mod cannot depend on a Quilt mod.
